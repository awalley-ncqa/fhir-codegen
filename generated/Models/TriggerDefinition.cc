The expression may be inlined, or may be a simple absolute URI, which is a reference to a named expression within a logic library referenced by a library element or extension within the containing resource. If the expression is a FHIR Path expression, it evaluates in the context of a resource of one of the type identified in the data requirement, and may also refer to the variable %previous for delta comparisons on events of type data-changed, data-modified, and data-deleted which will always have the same type.
