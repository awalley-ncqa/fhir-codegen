    /// Allergic (typically immune-mediated) reactions have been traditionally regarded as an indicator for potential escalation to significant future risk. Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians might not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term "allergy" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of "intolerance" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts might not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance. If, as is commonly the case, it is unclear whether the reaction is due to an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resource.

For example, when searching on category = medication, medication allergies that don't have a category valued will not be returned.  Refer to [search](search.html) for more information on how to search category with a :missing modifier to get allergies that don't have a category.

If this element is missing, the criticality is unknown (though it may be known elsewhere).  Systems that capture a severity at the condition level are actually representing the concept of criticality whereas the severity documented at the reaction level is representing the true reaction severity.  Existing systems that are capturing both condition criticality and reaction severity may use the term "severity" to represent both.  Criticality is the worst it could be in the future (i.e. situation-agnostic) whereas severity is situation-dependent.
